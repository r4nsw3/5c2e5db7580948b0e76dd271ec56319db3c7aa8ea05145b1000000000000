  |   G-00, and join forces with Gooigi to overcome the puzzling            |
  |   contraptions and mischievous boss on each themed floor. And that's    |
  |   just the Last Resort. Enter the ScareScraper for 8-player local       |

  |   clear other objectives before time runs out...in the ScareScraper!    |
  |   And for more mini-game madness, compete on teams at the ScreamPark!   |

  |   differ!                                                               |
